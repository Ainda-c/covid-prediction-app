# Ethical Considerations

st.markdown("""
### Data Quality and Bias
- The model's predictions may be affected by varying data quality across regions
- Some countries may have better reporting systems than others
- Testing capacity varies significantly between regions

### Fairness and Sustainability
- The model should be regularly retrained with new data
- Performance should be monitored across different regions
- Regular validation against ground truth data is essential
